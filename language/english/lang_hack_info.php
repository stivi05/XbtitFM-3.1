Highly improved H&R hack , it work now on both forum,s ( int and SMF ) , it have more option,s , code in sanity is improved to not give unable to jump to row 0 errors ( like V1 does ) you can use the Warn hack to lett hit and runners auto warn , or with the Bootes users hack , you can ban them for a few days , also you have a list of users who did hit and run with the ratio numbers , it is easy to spot if users try to cheat the system , and you have a instant ban button for those cheaters (or real bad users)

of coarse it have the standard function to punish hit and runners to take away some GB and send a pm to explain to the user what he did and what happen now 

[IMG]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/Clipboard01-53.jpg[/img]

the reward system works on all punishments , if you enable it , the user will get back the lost amount of GB , but also will be unwarned or unbanned ( if set ) and get a pm with the explanation 

[IMG]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/Clipboard01-52.jpg[/img]

you can made settings for each user group 

the hit and runners list have nice sort functions ( push a header name and it sort on that , push again it sort reversed )

then we have the hit and run block , with srolling tekst ( if you do not want all your users see this block , just set it for staff only )

[IMG]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/Clipboard01-54.jpg[/img]

and the acp settings

$language['SP_MENU']='Staff Panel';
$language['SP_INFO']='[b]Staff Panel by Lupin[/b]

here is a guide to using the staff panel, it might look hard but once you have done it a few times you will find it easy, as always first of goto admin panel and Enable it as shown in the following picture

[img]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/staff_panel1.jpg[/img]

once enaled we need to click on a hack for the tutorial i have chosen mass private mail take a look at the following picture

[img]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/staff_panel2.jpg[/img]

as you see from the image click on mass private mail then copy the link above only the part after the site address is needed  [b]index.php?page=admin&user=2&code=181781&do=masspm&action=write[/b]

once you have copied that link you need to then click on staff panel settings

[img]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/staff_panel3.jpg[/img]

then you will see the following settings screen

[img]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/staff_panel4.jpg[/img]

from the dropdown menu select the staff class you wish to set the panel up for then click on confirm you will then move on to the next screen

[img]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/staff_panel5.jpg[/img]

i have split this into 4 easy parts so you can very easy able to understand how it works


this part is all about the link you copied remember the mass private mail link, try to follow this right take your time cos if you get it wrong the link in your staffs admin panel will not work they will get a error saying they are not allowed to view another members panel etc. If that happens the only way to remove the link is in the database so follow the steps close   

1. In this part look at the link we copied and put the part after do= in this case its masspm every link in the admin panel has a different do= part so remember to change when you add other options to your staff panel

2. this one is a easy one this is just basically what you want the link to be called in there panel so you would put Mass Private Mail here and that is the name that will be displayed in your staff members panel

3. This one is very important you must get this right what you would put here is the link that we copied index.php?page=admin&user=2&code=181781&do=masspm&action=write but notice in the picture below we need to chage uer id and user code or th link will not work on your staff members pannel this part user=2 needs to be changed to user={uid} we also need to change this part code=181781 to code={ucode} make sure that is done for every option you add to your staff members panels

4. once you have everything looking like the pic below click on confirm

here is how it should look at this stage

[img]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/staff_panel6.jpg[/img]

once you are sure you have it right click on confirm then your staff member class you selected will be able to use this option, you can add as many links to the staff panel as you want the prosccess is just the same just remember to change user=2 to user{uid} and code=181781 to code={ucode} and you should be good to go. If you do make a mistake the only way to remove it is from the database log on to your database look for staff panel og the left click it then click on browse look for the bad link select then drop the table and try again.


oh one last thing before i forget once you have clicked confirm to add the new option to your staff members panel you will have to tick the box and click on confirm so that it shows in there panel other wise it will not show.

thats it hope this helps ya

The login is the same you would use for the xbtit database user for phpmyadmin.
Once logged in you have many options.

Database (Schema): The database you wish to backup
Charset: UTF8 in most cases would be the best option.
Compression: gzip 1 would be the smallest compression = bigger file, bzip(max) highest compression smallest file size, no compression full sized file.

This is what i would choose.
[img]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/cbt6.png[/img]

hit execute and the job will begin.
[img]'.$BASEURL.'/images/hack_info/cbt7.png[/img]
